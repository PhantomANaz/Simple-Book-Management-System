# Simple-Book-Management-System
Task-Based Round for the position of Back End (Junior) at  NITEX
It's my first Spring Boot project which I wasn't able to complete. With the help of YouTube videos, and stack overflow, I was able to do up to the 'Book' entity.
I've done this project in IntelliJ IDEA. By running TaskApplication.java and localhost in any browser, the project would be shown. Port is 1001.
